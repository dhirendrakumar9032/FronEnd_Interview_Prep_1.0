## FCP: Frist Contentfull Paint-

- First Contentful Paint measures how long it takes the browser to render the first piece of DOM content
 after a user navigates to your page. Images, non-white `<canvas>` elements, and SVGs on your page are 
 considered DOM content; anything inside an iframe isn't included.
