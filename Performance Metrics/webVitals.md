# What Are Web Vitals?

Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure the performance and user experience of a web page. They provide developers with a standardized framework to assess and optimize key aspects of a webpage, ensuring a better overall user experience. These metrics are crucial for understanding how users perceive and interact with a website.

## Core Web Vitals
The three main Web Vitals, also known as **Core Web Vitals**, are:

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **What it measures:** The loading performance of a page.
- **How it works:** LCP records the time it takes for the largest image or text block visible within the viewport to fully load.
- **Target:** Aim for LCP to occur within **2.5 seconds** of when the page starts loading.

### 2. First Input Delay (FID)
- **What it measures:** The interactivity of a page.
- **How it works:** FID tracks the time it takes for a page to respond to the first user interaction (e.g., clicking a button or link).
- **Target:** Aim for FID to be **less than 100 milliseconds**.

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- **What it measures:** The visual stability of a page.
- **How it works:** CLS quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during the loading process, which can negatively impact the user experience.
- **Target:** Aim for a CLS score of **less than 0.1**.

## Why Are Web Vitals Important?
Web Vitals are crucial for user experience because they measure key aspects of a webpage that directly affect how users perceive and interact with it. By optimizing these metrics, developers can:

- **Improve Loading Speed:** Ensure content is displayed quickly.
- **Enhance Responsiveness:** Minimize delays in user interactions.
- **Ensure Visual Stability:** Prevent unexpected layout shifts that frustrate users.
- **Boost User Satisfaction:** Fast, responsive, and stable pages lead to higher engagement and retention.
- **Improve SEO:** Google uses Core Web Vitals as part of its ranking factors, so better scores can lead to improved search engine visibility.

## Additional Metrics
While Core Web Vitals focus on the primary metrics, there are other supplementary Web Vitals that provide more insights:

1. **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Measures the time it takes for the server to respond.
2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Tracks the time it takes for the first piece of content to render.
3. **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Measures the time during which the main thread is blocked and unresponsive.

## How to Measure Web Vitals
You can measure Web Vitals using various tools:

1. **Google Tools:**
   - [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
   - Google Search Console's Core Web Vitals report
   - Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
2. **Third-Party Tools:**
   - WebPageTest
   - GTmetrix
3. **Real-User Monitoring (RUM):**
   - Integrate Web Vitals tracking directly into your analytics platform using JavaScript libraries like [web-vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals).
